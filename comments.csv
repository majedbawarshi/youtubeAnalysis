A class kinda _is_ a prototype. It's like if you combined a prototype and a structure.

*class.h*:
class Class {
  public:
    void someFunction();
}

*class.cpp*:
void Class::someFunction(){ ... }

class.h tells another file that uses it, that there exists a class type called Class, and that it has a function named someFunction.

when class.cpp is compiled, the implementation is defined, and when another file uses the interface defined in class.h, it knows where to go to look for the implementation. Of course when everything is linked together, it's all binary and none of the abstractions really matter, but that's beside the point.

Classes can also be forward-declared like so:

class Class;

You would do that in a header file when the compiler can't otherwise know that Class exists.

>""and it worked if the class was above main. but let's say I have my class below main""

Let's get this straight, *you should never define main() anywhere but at the bottom of the file*. No exceptions. Nothing should go below it. main should be in its own file, and if it shares a file with other functions, then main should be at the bottom. Always. That's the convention, and it isn't wise to go against it. It doesn't make sense to put something below main.
